        "\n",
        "The seminar provides a guide of how to work with genome scale metabolic models (GSMM) of micro-organisms. The example organism we use is *E. coli*, for which reliable models are available in online databases. The goal is to get insight into flux distributions and general metabolic state as well as to find flux solutions that represent the highest possible over-produce of a metabolite, in our example succinate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The seminar uses Jupyter notebooks, a new way to use and visualize code in the web. Such a notebook is composed of a sequence of cells. Cellls can be either text/comments, like this introduction, or it contains python code to be run. In this example the code is evaluated by the cloud service [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). The output for each code-cell is shown directly below it. For a overview on Jupyter notebooks read [this review](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1). Another usefull resource to develop Jupyter notebooks is via [Google Colaboration](https://colab.research.google.com).\n",

More information on DD-DeDaF and the original files are [here](https://github.com/DD-DeCaF/tutorials). The simulations are performed using cobrapy (see [Ebrahim et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-7-74)), the most widely used analysis tool for genome scale metabolic models.\n",
